Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy)
This protocol is called Secure Shell or SSH for short and is the common means of connecting to and interacting with the command line of a remote Linux machine.

What is SSH & How Does it Work?
Secure Shell or SSH Simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network - where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine, such as in the diagram below.

SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely
Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it's sent over a network such as internet


Using SSH to Login to Your Linux Machine
The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:
1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine

For example: ssh bob@10.10.133.181


Introduction to Flags & Switches

A majority of commands allow for arguments to be provided. These arguments are identified by a hyphen and a certain keyword known as flags or switches.

We'll later discuss how we can identify what commands allow for arguments to be provided and understanding what these do exactly.

When using a command, unless otherwise specified, it will perform its default behaviour. For example, ls lists the contents of the working directory. However, hidden files are not shown. We can use flags and switches to extend the behaviour of commands.

Using our ls example, ls informs us that there is only one folder named "folder1" as highlighted in the screenshot below.

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls
folder1
tryhackme@linux2:~$
        
However, after using the -a argument (short for --all), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as ".hiddenfolder". Files and folders with "." are hidden files.

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls -a 
.hiddenfolder folder1
tryhackme@linux2:~$

Commands that accept these will also have a --help option. This option will list the possible options that the command accepts, provide a brief description and example of how to use it.

           
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls --help
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them;
                               e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
      --file-type            likewise, except do not append '*'
      --format=WORD          across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l,
                               single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C
      --full-time            like -l --time-style=full-iso
  -g                         like -l, but do not list owner
      --group-directories-first
tryhackme@linux2:~$


This option is, in fact, a formatted output of what is called the man page (short for manual), which contains documentation for Linux commands and applications.

The Man(ual) Page
The manual pages are a great source of information for both system commands and applications available on both a Linux machine, which is accessible on the machine itself and online.

To access this documentation, we can use the man command and then provide the command we want to read the documentation for. Using our ls example, we would use man ls to view the manual pages for ls like so:
           
tryhackme@linux2:~$ man ls
LS(1)                                               User Commands                                               LS(1)

Filesystem Interaction

We covered some of the most fundamental commands when interacting with the filesystem on the Linux machine. For example, we covered how to list and find the contents of folders using `ls` and find and navigating the filesystem using `cd`. 
In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:
       create files and folders
       move files and folders
       delete files and folders
More specific the following command

Command       Full Name            Purpose
touch         touch                Create File
mkdir         make directory       Create a folder
cp            copy                 Copy a file or a folder
mv            move                 Move a file or a folder
rm            remove               Remove a file or a folder        
file          file                 Determine the type of a file


Creating Files and Folders (touch, mkdir)
Creating files and folders on Linux is a simple process. First, we'll cover creating a file. The touch command takes exactly one argument -- the name we want to give the file we create. For example, we can create the file "note" by using touch note. It's worth noting that touch simply creates a blank file. You would need to use commands like echo or text editors such as nano to add content to the blank file.

~$ touch note
~$ ls           
folder1 note

This is a similar process for making a folder, which just involves using the mkdir command and again providing the name that we want to assign to the directory. For example, creating the directory "mydirectory" using mkdir mydirectory.

~$ mkdir mydirectory
~$ ls           
folder1 mydirectory note

Removing Files and Folders (rm)
rm is extraordinary out of the commands that we've covered so far. You can simply remove files by using rm. However, you need to provide the -R switch alongside the name of the directory you wish to remove.

~$ rm note
~$ ls           
folder1 mydirectory


~$ rm -R mydirectory
~$ ls           
folder1

Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)
Copying and moving files is an important functionality on a Linux machine. Starting with cp, this command takes two arguments: 
1. the name of the existing file
2. the name we wish to assign to the new file when copying
cp copies the entire contents of the existing file into the new file. In the screenshot below, we are copying "note" to "note2".

~$ cp note note2
~$ ls     
folder1 note note2

Moving a file takes two arguments, just like the cp command. However, rather than copying and/or creating a new file, mv will merge or modify the second file that we provide as an argument. Not only can you use mv to move a file to a new folder, but you can also use mv to rename a file or folder. For example, in the screenshot below, we are renaming the file "note2" to be named "note3". "note3" will now have the contents of "note2". 

~$ mv note2 note3
~$ ls  
folder1 note note3

Determining File Type
What is often misleading and often catches people out is making presumptions from files as to what their purpose or contents may be. Files usually have what's known as an extension to make this easier. For example, text files usually have an extension of ".txt". But this is not necessary.

So far, the files we have used in our examples haven't had an extension. Without knowing the context of why the file is there -- we don't really know its purpose. Enter the file command. This command takes one argument. For example, we'll use file to confirm whether or not the "note" file in our examples is indeed a text file, like so file note

~$ file note
note: ASCII text



Permissions 101
As you would have already found out by now, certain users cannot access certain files or folders. We've previously explored some commands that can be used to determine what access we have and where it leads us. 
In our previous tasks, we learned how to extend the use of commands through flags and switches. Take, for example, the ls command, which lists the contents of the current directory. When using the -l switch, we can see ten columns such as in the screenshot below. However, we're only interested in the first three columns:

~$ ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file1
-rw-r--r-- 8 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file2

Although intimidating, these three columns are very important in determining certain characteristics of a file or folder and whether or not we have access to it. A file or folder can have a couple of characteristics that determine both what actions are allowed and what user or group has the ability to perform the given action -- such as the following:
       Read
       Write
       Execute

Using su to switch to user2

~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$


Briefly: The Differences Between Users & Groups
The great thing about Linux is that permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.

Let's put this into a real-world context; the system user that runs a web server must have permissions to read and write files for an effective web application. However, companies such as web hosting companies will have to want to allow their customers to upload their own files for their website without being the webserver system user -- compromising the security of every other customer. 


Switching Between Users
Switching between users on a Linux install is easy work thanks to the su command. Unless you are the root user (or using root permissions through sudo), then you are required to know two things to facilitate this transition of user accounts:
       The user we wish to switch to
       The user's password

~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/

For example, when using su to switch to "user2", our new session drops us into our previous user's home directory. 

Where now, after using -l, our new session has dropped us into the home directory of "user" automatically.
